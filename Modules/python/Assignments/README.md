1.  Using the [Titanic dataset]( <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>), create a Python class to perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA). Implement methods to visualize the distribution of survival rates based on different features such as 'Pclass', 'Sex', and 'Age'. Use Matplotlib for visualization. 

**Requirements**:

-   Create a class `TitanicEDA` with methods to load data, generate summary statistics, and create visualizations.
-   Use Pandas for data manipulation.
-   Visualize the distribution of survival rates and other features.
-   Save visualizations as image files.

2.  Using the [House Prices dataset]( <https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data>), create a FastAPI endpoint that returns predictions for house prices based on user-provided features. Use a simple linear regression model for prediction.

**Requirements**:

-   Implement a `HousePricePredictor` class to handle data preprocessing and prediction.
-   Create a FastAPI endpoint that accepts house features and returns the predicted price.
-   Use scikit-learn for the regression model.

3.  Using the [Wine Quality dataset]( <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009>), create a FastAPI endpoint to filter wine data based on quality and visualize the distribution of certain features. Use Pandas for filtering and Matplotlib for visualization.

**Requirements**

-   Implement a `WineDataFilter` class to filter data based on quality.
-   Create a FastAPI endpoint that returns filtered data and visualizations of feature distributions.
-   Save visualizations as image files.
<br><br><br><br>
4.  Implement a custom iterator to process the [Mall Customer Segmentation dataset]( <https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python>). The iterator should stream data in chunks and allow for incremental analysis.

**Requirements**

-   Create a `ChunkIterator` class to iterate over chunks of the dataset.
-   Implement a method to calculate and return basic statistics for each chunk.
<br><br><br><br>
5.  Create a decorator to time the execution of methods in a class that processes data from the [Supermarket Sales dataset]( <https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales>). The class should include methods to summarize data and plot sales over time.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a `timing_decorator` to measure execution time.
- Create a `SalesDataProcessor` class with methods to process and visualize sales data.
- Apply the decorator to these methods.
<br><br><br><br>
6.  Using the Iris dataset, create a FastAPI endpoint to filter iris data based on species and visualize the distribution of certain features. Use Pandas for filtering and Matplotlib for visualization. (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris>)

**Requirements:**

-   Implement an IrisDataFilter class to filter data based on species.
-   Create a FastAPI endpoint that returns filtered data and visualizations of feature distributions.
-   Save visualizations as image file
